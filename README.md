# whats-for-dinner

A simple CLI for suggesting a random meal to make for dinner, from a static list of meals that I know how to cook.

# Why though?

1. To solve this very real and recurring problem.
1. Like many of my recent projects, to practice rust.

# Features for the future

* Snooze (hide a meal for a couple of weeks before suggesting again) - powered via local, ephemeral data
* Snooze on selected meal (for like five days or something)
* Add different kinds of lists (side dish, restaurant)
* Bundle .txt files along with binary
* Keyword/tag based search
